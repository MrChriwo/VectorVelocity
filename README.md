# VectorVelocity Lab

Welcome to the **VectorVelocity Lab** branch!

## Purpose

The focus of this branch is to develop and evaluate agents within the VectorVelocity environment. Here, we experiment with various reinforcement learning algorithms and strategies to improve the performance and capabilities of our agents.

## Getting Started

To get started with developing and evaluating agents in this branch, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:** Start by cloning the repository and checking out the `lab` branch.
   ```bash
   git clone -b lab https://github.com/MrChriwo/VectorVelocity.git
   ```


2. **Run in Docker:** You can either install the dependencies on your local machine or use the docker container, which will run a jupyter server wuth all dependencies
