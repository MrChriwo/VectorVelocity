# VectorVelocity Lab

Welcome to the **VectorVelocity Lab** branch!

## Purpose

The focus of this branch is to develop and evaluate agents within the VectorVelocity environment. Here, we experiment with various reinforcement learning algorithms and strategies to improve the performance and capabilities of our agents.

## Getting Started

To get started with developing and evaluating agents in this branch, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:** Start by cloning the repository and checking out the `lab` branch.
   ```bash
   git clone -b lab https://github.com/MrChriwo/VectorVelocity.git
   ```


2. **Run in Docker:** You can run the entire lab inside our VSC Dev container. For that you need to ensure that you have installed the ```ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers``` extension in your visual studio code. On the left bottom cornor you can then click on the blue button and select "reopen in container". This will setup the entire dev enviornment for you.

**NOTE** Make sure you select the base python enviornment for running the notebooks. Inside the dev container you can not render the game in human mode. For that you currently need to install the requirements-dev.txt locally.
