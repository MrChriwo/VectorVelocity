## Contribution Process üîÑ

1. **Familiarize Yourself with the Code:** Before making contributions, please take some time to understand the existing codebase and check out the documentation.
2. **Documentation:** Any new functionality added must be reflected in the documentation. 
3. **Testing:** Opening a merge request into the `dev` branch triggers automated testing for Python versions 3.9 up to 3.12 and documentation testing for any changes.
4. **Encapsulation and Maintenance:** Ensure your code is encapsulated well for easier maintenance. Clean code is always appreciated.
5. **Unit Tests:** If your changes impact functionality, ensure that new or changed functionality is reflected in the tests/ folder so that unit tests can properly test the functionality.
6. **Review Process:** Be open to feedback during the PR review process. It's a collaborative effort to maintain and improve the project.

## Additional Points ‚ûï

- **Consistency:** Maintain coding style and conventions used in the existing codebase.
- **Unit Tests:** Adding unit tests for new features or bug fixes is highly recommended.
- **Review Process:** Be open to feedback during the PR review process. It's a collaborative effort to maintain and improve the project.
